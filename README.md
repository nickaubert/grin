Nyet / Tint (Tetris) clone in golang

This game runs in the terminal using the Termbox library.  You can set the well
height and depth, number of rows of starting junk, and run with an extented 
piece set.  High scores stored in sqlite.

$ grin -h

  -d=20: well depth

  -e=false: Use extended pieces set

  -j=0: Starting junk

  -w=10: well width

This is really an excuse to learn Go.
